In this repository, you can get further understandings about the distributed system.

there are "service-registry" and "service-discovery" that enhance the availability and mutual-connectivity.

service-registry : a centralized DB that manages metadata from the service.(location, status, version)

service-discovery : being integrated with a service-registry, the clients can query the location and metadata about a service.
just like an interface between metadata and clients.

by using the objects in this repository, you can upgrade customed microservices and simplify your distributed
architecture.
